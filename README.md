# Obstacle Avoidance Robot
* ROS2 Humble
  
* Gazebo
  
* Rviz
#### Installation:

Ensure ROS2 Humble is installed on your system.

Install Gazebo and Rviz using the respective installation instructions for your platform.

#### Usage:

1- Launch the simulation environment.

2- Explore the 2D visualized map generated by the robot in Rviz.

3- Observe the robot's obstacle avoidance capabilities in the Gazebo simulation.

#### Concepts:

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
The project employs SLAM techniques to enable the robot to create a 2D visual map of its environment while simultaneously determining its own location within that space.

Nav2 (Navigation2)
Nav2 is utilized to enhance the robot's navigation capabilities, enabling it to efficiently plan and execute paths while avoiding obstacles in real-time.
